# Sora 2 Prompt — Looping Fabrication Yard Hero Visual

## Recommended Homepage Placement

Use this clip as the **homepage hero background** (behind headline + CTA) with a subtle dark gradient overlay for text readability.

## Prompt for Sora 2 (15-second seamless loop)

```text
Create a seamless 15-second cinematic looping video for a website homepage hero section.

Scene:
A modern industrial fabrication yard at golden hour turning into cool dusk tones. Wide composition with steel beams, stacked fabricated components, gantry cranes, welding stations, and marked work zones. No visible brand logos.

Core concept:
The scene should feel like a real, working fabrication yard augmented by a clean AR data layer.

AR overlay requirements:
- Persistent vector point markers anchored to physical objects (beams, joints, crane hooks, pallets, stations)
- Thin geometric tracking lines and subtle triangulation meshes
- Floating technical labels near key objects (examples: "Beam A12", "Weld Node 07", "Tolerance ±0.8mm", "Stage: QA", "Lift Path")
- Depth-correct overlays that stay locked to objects as camera moves
- Occasional soft pulse on selected data points
- Overlay style is minimal, precise, and engineering-grade (not sci-fi HUD clutter)

Visual style:
- Photorealistic footage base
- Premium enterprise-tech aesthetic
- Controlled contrast, clean highlights, realistic shadows
- Palette: industrial neutrals (graphite, steel, concrete) with AR accents in cyan/teal/soft white
- No people in close foreground; if workers are present, keep them small/background and non-identifiable

Camera & motion:
- Slow lateral dolly with slight parallax
- Calm, stable movement (no fast pans, no jitter)
- Motion should support seamless looping

Looping requirement:
- First and last frames must align perfectly for an invisible loop
- Keep object and overlay continuity consistent across loop boundary

Output specs:
- Duration: 15 seconds
- Aspect ratio: 16:9
- Resolution: 1920x1080 minimum (4K master preferred)
- Frame rate: 24fps
- Deliverables: MP4 (H.264 high bitrate) and WebM (VP9)
- Optimized for autoplaying muted web hero background

Negative constraints:
- No logos, no UI mockups, no subtitles, no watermark
- No chaotic sparks/explosions or dramatic action
- No extreme depth-of-field blur that hides yard detail
```

## Optional Variant Prompt (Darker, More Technical)

```text
Generate the same scene and loop behavior, but with cooler dusk lighting, slightly reduced atmospheric haze, and denser AR point labeling for a more technical "digital twin" feel while preserving readability and minimalism.
