# Governance & Integrity Statement

## Core Freeze Discipline
Core mutation is constrained by explicit approval gates and scope controls.

## Approval Gate Model
High-risk transitions require structured approvals with rollback plans.

## No Hallucinated Capability Policy
System messaging must not claim capabilities not active in current phase.

## Data Integrity Commitment
All performance claims tied to measured, auditable metrics.
