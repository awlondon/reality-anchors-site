## Core Value Narrative
- Scrap reduction through measurable bend feedback loops.
- Precision bend control with deterministic correction guidance.
- Voluntary operator participation: signal without coercion.
- Governance-first rollout: constrained, auditable, reversible.

## Homepage Positioning Blocks
1. Economic Value: reduce scrap and rework cost.
2. Operational Control: deterministic quality loop.
3. Trust Layer: strict gates, no speculative rollouts.
4. Validation Path: pilot -> evidence -> controlled scale.

## Claims Discipline
Do not claim sync, aggregation dashboards, or multi-operator scale unless active.
