# Sora 2 Prompt: Fabrication Yard AR Overlay Loop (15s)

Create a **15-second seamless looping cinematic clip** of a large industrial fabrication yard at golden-hour dusk, viewed from a slow, stabilized aerial drift at about 20 feet high.

The yard contains steel beams, stacked pipes, welding stations, forklifts, gantry cranes, and partially assembled structures. Workers in PPE move naturally in the background. The atmosphere is slightly dusty with soft light rays and subtle heat shimmer.

Overlay a clean, futuristic **AR interface** throughout the scene:
- Floating vector anchor points on key objects (beams, crane joints, pallets, work zones).
- Thin neon-cyan and amber lines connecting points into geometric measurement guides.
- Legible labels and IDs (e.g., "BAY-03", "CUT STATION A", "LOAD ZONE", "CRANE ARM ANGLE 42°", "TEMP 78°F").
- Small data cards that softly animate in/out with tracking markers.
- Occasional pulsing dots and scanning sweeps to imply live spatial mapping.

Visual style:
- Photoreal industrial environment + high-end holographic AR graphics.
- Color palette: steel gray, rust orange, dusty beige, with cyan/teal AR accents.
- Medium contrast, realistic lighting, filmic tone, ultra-detailed textures.
- Keep UI elegant, uncluttered, and readable.

Motion and loop behavior:
- Camera movement must be gentle and continuous, returning to the exact framing at the end.
- AR elements should animate cyclically so the start/end states match for a perfect loop.
- No abrupt transitions, no cuts, no text glitches.

Output constraints:
- Duration exactly 15 seconds.
- 16:9 aspect ratio, 4K quality.
- No logos or watermarks.
